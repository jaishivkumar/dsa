// Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

//best case  average case  wast case  

//Big O(logn) => As complexity is often related to divide and conquer algorithms, O(log(n)) is generally a good complexity you can reach for sorting algorithms.

// First Loop runs N Time whereas Second Loop runs M Time. The calculation takes O(1)times. So by adding them the time complexity ...
