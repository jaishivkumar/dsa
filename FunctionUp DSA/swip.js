// time complexity  and spce complexity
// time complexity =>  Time complexity is the computational complexity describing the amount of time required for the execution of an algorithm. Time complexity measures the time taken by every statement of the algorithm.

// Space complexity => Space complexity represents the amount of memory one program uses in order to achieve its execution. Because a program needs memory to store input data and temporal values while being executed, 

// Big O (logn)  
// Big O (n) => 
// Big O (n^2) => 


// let c = a;
// console.log(a,b);
// a = b;
// b = c;
// console.log(a,b);
